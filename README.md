# DriveTestUltra
 Tests Drives and Exports to CSV, Excel, and [soon] Word

## How it works
 This program initially asks for the drive letter and the name you wish to set the drive to. It will then run tests, output to a csv conveniently located in your Documents folder, and output to an excel doc also located in your Documents folder (separated by Worksheet name which equals the new name)
